# Figma MCP Web Design Test Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates using Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with GitHub Copilot with Claude to generate a complete website from a Figma design. No changes have been made to the AI-generated code - this represents the raw output from Claude via GitHub Copilot.

## Technical Details

- **Model**: Claude 3 Opus (via GitHub Copilot)
- **MCP Server**: Figma MCP Browser Extension
- **Date Created**: May 5, 2025
- **Figma Design**: [AHSTC Design](https://www.figma.com/design/B4IpubhCTzuC0zHWVyNJTn/AHSTC?node-id=15-1053&t=PJ8l6EFY2WDLZFcx-11)

## Original Prompt

```
Use figma mcp to get https://www.figma.com/design/B4IpubhCTzuC0zHWVyNJTn/AHSTC?node-id=15-1053&t=PJ8l6EFY2WDLZFcx-11 and make html webpage
```

## Process
1. The AI accessed the Figma design using the MCP (Model Context Protocol)
2. It extracted design elements, layout, colors, and content
3. It downloaded necessary images from the Figma design
4. It generated HTML structure based on the design
5. It created CSS styling to match the visual design from Figma
6. It incorporated responsive design elements for different screen sizes

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML webpage
- `styles.css`: CSS styling for the webpage
- `images/`: Directory containing all images extracted from the Figma design

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive design
- Styling that closely matches the original Figma design
- Image assets extracted directly from Figma

## Note
This project showcases the capability of AI to transform design assets into functional code without human intervention. The code is presented exactly as generated by the AI.
